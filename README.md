# 🐍 Core Python Learning – Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to my **Core Python Learning Repository** 🎓  
This contains all the Python concepts I learned step by step in class, organized as Jupyter Notebooks.  
Each file includes explanations, examples, and practice work.

## 🚀 Learning Path

### 🟢 1. Basics of Python
- 📄 [My First Program](Myfirstpgm1.ipynb) – Printing output and understanding basic syntax.  
- ➕ [Operators](Operators2.ipynb) – Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.
- 📝 [Statements](Statements3.ipynb) – Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`).   

---

### 🔄 2. Control Flow
- 🔁 [For Loop](for%20loop6.ipynb) – Iterating over sequences with `for`.  
- 🔂 [While Loop](while%20loop7.ipynb) – Repetition using `while` and loop control statements.  
- ⚠️ [Error Handling](Handling%20error16.ipynb) – `try`, `except`, `finally`, and raising exceptions.  

---

### 📦 3. Data Structures
- 📋 [Lists](List4.ipynb) – Creating, accessing, slicing, and modifying lists.  
- 🧾 [Lists & Tuples](List%20and%20tuples5.ipynb) – Difference between lists and tuples.  
- ⚡ [List Comprehension](list%20comprehension8.ipynb) – Short, efficient way to build lists.
- 🌀 [Sets](sets9.ipynb) – Creating sets, union, intersection, and set operations.   
- 🔑 [Dictionary](Dictionary10.ipynb) – Key-value pairs, adding/removing/accessing elements.

### 🛠️ 4. Functions
- 🏗️ [Functions](Function11.ipynb) – Defining and calling functions.  
- 🎯 [Arguments](Arguments12.ipynb) – Positional, keyword, default, and variable-length arguments.  
- ⚙️ [Built-in Functions](Builtin%20function13.ipynb) – Using common functions like `len()`, `range()`, `type()`, etc.  

---

### 🏛️ 5. Object-Oriented Programming
- 🐾 [OOPs Concepts](OOPS14.ipynb) – Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.  

---

### 🚧 6. Advanced Python
- 🔍 [Regular Expressions](Regularexpression15.ipynb) – Pattern matching with the `re` module.  

---

### 📊 7. Data Science Libraries
- 🔢 [NumPy](NumPy17.ipynb) – Arrays, mathematical operations, indexing, slicing.  
- 📑 [Pandas](Pandas18.ipynb) – Series, DataFrames, reading/writing CSV files, data manipulation.  
- 📉 [Matplotlib](Matplotlib19.ipynb) – Plots: line, bar, histogram, scatter.  
- 🎨 [Seaborn](Seaborn20.ipynb) – Advanced visualizations (heatmaps, pairplots, categorical plots).
